# REACT & REDUX CRYPTO APP

> This React capstone project (remember what are they?)is about building a mobile web application to check a list of metrics (numeric values) that you will create making use of React and Redux.

You will select an API that provides numeric data about a topic that you like and then build the webapp around it. The webapp will have several pages:

- one page with a list of Cryptocurrencies that could be filtered by current ranking.

- one page for the Cryptocurrency details for example: price in USD, current rank, symbol, market value e.t.c.
